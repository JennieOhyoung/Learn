Exercise 4
==========

2. The links should include at least two query string parameters:
       - twitter handle sending the tweet
       - text of the tweet

3. Tweet the link and click it!

4. Checkout Hackbrightâ€™s Google Analytics to confirm the pageviews with your params are there!

Exercise 5
==========

Given image beacons a try!

Steps. 

1. Go to [Beacon Docs](https://keen.io/docs/data-collection/image-beacon/) for details on how to make a beacon URL.

2. To construct your beacon image URL, you'll need to create an event body like this:

```json
{
    "campaign" : "Testing from analytics class!",
    "subject" : "Hi",
    "text" : "espionage blah blah"
}
```

Don't forget to [base64 encode it](http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/base64encode/) before putting it into the redirect URL!

3. Write an email which contains a fake beacon image. You'll need to use an email editor that allows you to put HTML in the email. Like [this one](http://ctrlq.org/html-mail/).

4. Send it and get someone to open the email. See if the tracking works!

5. What are some drawbacks to using beacons?


Exercise 6

1. Create a tweet that links to ANY website. 

2. The link should be a [Keen IO redirect link](https://keen.io/docs/data-collection/redirect/) that includes at least 3 properties.
    - site being linked to "My Rad Blog"
    - tweet text "My analytics teacher is making me tweet this link..."
    - twitter account posting the tweet "@HackerNewsOnion"
