Exercise 3
==========

1. Write a tweet that links to Hackbright.

2. The links should include at least two query string parameters:
       - twitter handle sending the tweet
       - text of the tweet

3. Tweet the link and click it!

4. Together we will checkout Hackbrightâ€™s Google Analytics to confirm the pageviews with your params are there!
