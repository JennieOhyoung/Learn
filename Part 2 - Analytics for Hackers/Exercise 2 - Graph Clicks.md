Exercise 2 - Graph Clicks
=========================

We'll build off the changes we made in exercise 1. In this exercise, we'll work on a stats page [(SampleSite/stats.html)](./SampleSite). to display some of the data on the user engagement with engage button.

Steps:

1. Make sure you have the SampleSite folder & files on your local machine. Open stats.html in your browser to take a look at it.

2. Modify the read key and project ID in the file to point to your project.

3. Add two new graphs to the stats page, as specified in the file.

The Solution can be found in the [Solution](./Solution) folder.
