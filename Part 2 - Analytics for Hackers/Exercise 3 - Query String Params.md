Exercise 3 - Query String Parameters
====================================

1. Write a tweet that links to Hackbright. Let's see whose tweet gets the most clicks!

2. The links should include at least two query string parameters:
       - twitter handle sending the tweet
       - short description of the tweet

    example: 
    
    ```
    http://hackbrightacademy.com/?source=@doge&tweet_text=very_programming_such_intelligence
    ```
       
3. Tweet the link and click it!

4. Together we will checkout Hackbrightâ€™s Google Analytics to confirm the pageviews with your params are there!

5. Think of 1-2 drawbacks to using query string params and be prepared to share them with the class.
