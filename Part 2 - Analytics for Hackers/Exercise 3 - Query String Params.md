Exercise 3
==========

1. Write a tweet that links to Hackbright. Let's see whose tweet gets the most clicks!

2. The links should include at least two query string parameters:
       - twitter handle sending the tweet
       - text of the tweet

    example: 
    
    ```
    https://hackbrightacademy.com/?source=@doge&tweet_text=VERY%20PROGRAMMING.%20WOW.%20SUCH%20FEMALES.%20SO%20AMAZE.%20MUCH%20INTELLIGENCE.
    ```
       
3. Tweet the link and click it!

4. Together we will checkout Hackbrightâ€™s Google Analytics to confirm the pageviews with your params are there!

5. Think of 1-2 drawbacks to using query string params and be prepared to share them with the class.
